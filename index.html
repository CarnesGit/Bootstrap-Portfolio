                    I was born in Boston, MA in 1980. I grew up in a small town called Bridgewater, MA and lived there until 2001 when I joined the U.S. Army as a Paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. In 2006, after completing 3 combat tours, and almost 5 years of service,
                    I received an honorable discharge at the rank of Sergeant, and moved to Coral Springs, FL.

                <p style="text-indent: 2.0em; ">
                    I started working for a security company, and worked my way up from a Security Officer to the Operations Director in two short years. I held the ranks of "Officer ", "Post Captain ", "Major ", "Field Training Officer ", and "Chief Field Training Officer
                    " before obtaining the Directors postion. I worked there from 2006 until 2010 when my wife and I moved to where her family was located in Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2.0em; ">
                    Two years after that I started working at the University of Pennsylvania as a Gardener. I have worked at UPenn now for 7 years and that is where I learned of a course offered called "UPenn Coding Bootcamp ". I am now enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp to
                    explore my lifelong passion with computers and persue a career that I will love instead of just working for the money. This is a career path that I am very excited to explore.
