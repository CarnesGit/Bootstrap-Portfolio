# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is the second homework assignment for the course. I was told to recreate the first assignment, this time using bootstrap. I was also told that this time I could use a little creative freedom as far as colors and backgrounds are concerned. I took this liberty and adding my own styling to the body background, navbar background, container background, footer background, and some text colors. I also added some stroke to some of the text in order to make the writing clearer against the background with my chosen color for the font.
